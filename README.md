## Download

HomeConMenu is available for free only on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/homeconmenu/id1615397537) only, because Apple does not allow us to sign and notarize binaries that use HomeKit framework.
To tell the truth, I don't want to publish on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/homeconmenu/id1615397537) because it would be too much trouble.

## Privacy control

For testing, you can reset the status of privacy control to access HomeKit.
